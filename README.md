# ExampleBot

An example discord bot boilerplate for beginners.

## Setup

In the `config.json` file, you just need to pop in your token in place.

```json
{
    "discord": {
        "token": "Insert token here"
    }
}
```

If you don't have a Discord application with a bot account associated, you can create one in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and a bit of extra reading [here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#bots).
